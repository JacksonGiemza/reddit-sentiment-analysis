You & I have no idea the circumstances or reasoning as to why others make the money they make the way they do. 

It could be someone who dashes once or twice on the way home from work to cover a lunch bill or get some extra money for dinner, or even extra gas money.

Someone could be an independent contractor (outside of courier services) and be in between jobs for a little bit.

Others could be using multiple services when not on the other. Get off Doordash, go to Uber, then Ubereats, to Grub Hub, etc. The “50k car or 100k car” could be primarily used for Ride Sharing services that are upper end like Uber XL or so be it.

I just don’t get the judgement of people who are actively working. Who cares? There’s a demand for couriers, they are supplying it. 

Hell, that super expensive car could be a loaner or a relatives that they are borrowing.

Who’s more questionable, the person delivering food in a nice car, or the customer ordering a personal taxi for their food (plus fees, times etc.) for convenience sake and then getting weird about their driver / tipping. Pretty sure you can do payment plans on those apps now too, which is even more of a questionable act.

(Immediate downvotes is weird, Doordash was initially marketed towards people who just want to make a few extra dollars, with commuting in mind)
