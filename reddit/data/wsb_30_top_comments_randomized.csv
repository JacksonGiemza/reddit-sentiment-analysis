You & I have no idea the circumstances or reasoning as to why others make the money they make the way they do. 

It could be someone who dashes once or twice on the way home from work to cover a lunch bill or get some extra money for dinner, or even extra gas money.

Someone could be an independent contractor (outside of courier services) and be in between jobs for a little bit.

Others could be using multiple services when not on the other. Get off Doordash, go to Uber, then Ubereats, to Grub Hub, etc. The “50k car or 100k car” could be primarily used for Ride Sharing services that are upper end like Uber XL or so be it.

I just don’t get the judgement of people who are actively working. Who cares? There’s a demand for couriers, they are supplying it. 

Hell, that super expensive car could be a loaner or a relatives that they are borrowing.

Who’s more questionable, the person delivering food in a nice car, or the customer ordering a personal taxi for their food (plus fees, times etc.) for convenience sake and then getting weird about their driver / tipping. Pretty sure you can do payment plans on those apps now too, which is even more of a questionable act.

(Immediate downvotes is weird, Doordash was initially marketed towards people who just want to make a few extra dollars, with commuting in mind)

Any country responding to these tariffs that is on that list better have a good explanation for why they are increasing their own tariffs. I look forward to the scrambling for explanations.

My wife is Vietnamese, but Viet Nam tariffs American imports by 90%? If that is true, then fuck them, 45% tariffs on Vietnamese imports into this country are justified.

And they tend to not work very in your favour when you decide to tariff EVERYONE.

Let’s imagine I have a candy shop. And in the street right next to my shop, there’s another candy shop.

I have a tariff imposed on me by the district on candy sold to students that I bought from a supplier, so everytime I sell that kind of candy to kids, they pay a little more.

Now take into consideration, I can make SOME candy, but I still buy way more candy from my supplier than what I make myself. And kids like my suppliers candy better than my own.

I get mad at this, what do I do? I impose a tariff on my candy supplier, and somehow, I try to reason with everyone that the supplier is the one paying this tariff extra.

In reality, I make kids pay the extra. I hope they buy the candy I make, but instead they decide to just go the candy shop across the street instead.

Now I’m forced to make pretty much all of the candy I sell only to keep my clientele, and I’m not ready for it. I may try to make the candy my supplier makes for me, but it will take time. I may never be capable of doing so. I may also be ready eventually, and at that time it can be too late and the candy shop across the street may have all the kids addicted to crack, and here I am, crackless, tired, with no clients, no money and with a shitty relation with my supplier.

Hopefully, in 4 years I will close my candy shop, someone else will come and buy the business, amend the relation with the supplier and try to fix all of this mess.

Edit: In a more serious note, tariffs could work to protect your businesses and to guarantee your populace buys locally and buys something with better quality.

But this only works when you tariff shit you can actually make profitably in house.

It tends to go to shit as soon as you start applying tariffs  left and right, to business partners, trade allies, to goods your businesses need to keep production, goods you simply are not ready to produce, and goods made by American companies on foreign soil.

I use 8 monitors to watch/manage at minimum 16 charts, not to watch my P&L.  
My strategy just works off making $0.50/per share moves on a variety of equities priced between $15-40 in addition to the SOXS/SOXL so I can always make money regardless of market direction, even in both directions during the day.

I make weekly income and don't concern myself with trying to be an overnight millionaire.  Just looking at financial freedom, no bills/debt, making a comfortable living and racing full time.
