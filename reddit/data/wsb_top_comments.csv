1jioony,BUY EVERYTHING,mjhj8s0,boat_hamster,"The 2008 crash is different to the crash that appears to be on the horizon. 

Quick history lesson. The 2008 crash was caused by high risk, arguably designed to default, mortgages being bundled with lower risk mortgage debt, and being sold on as mortgage backed securities. These securities were given a higher credit rating than they should have been, because ratings' agencies wanted to keep their customers happy. Once it became clear that banks were sitting on riskier debt than they thought they were, and no one knew who was holding what, intra-bank lending stopped, and most other forms of lending stopped. Things went from great to crisis really quickly.   
In the UK, not sure about the US, it was at the time referred to as the Credit Crunch. Mortgages, credit cards and everything inbetween, became hard to get, collapsing consumer spending. Businesses also lost access to the credit they needed to remaining trading.   
In response, central banks printed money to prop the banks up, and encourage lending again. The low inflation environment enable near-zero interest rates until the global supply chain collapsed in 2020, causing inflation. 

The possible incoming tariff recession will be due to another serious disruption of the global supply chain. This will be inflationary, and probably will lead to higher interest rates. But it won't bring the financial system to a halt, as in 2008.  Of course, this all hinges on tariffs actually being implemented, and that is far from certain. Without them, we may have a short, shallow recession, but that should not be a cause for panic.

TLDR: 2008 was a failure of the financial system, not the economy. If we do have a recession coming, it will resemble a more 'normal' recession caused by falling demand. So 2008 shouldn't be used as a roadmap for negotiating the next one.",3,1742828033.0

In the movie, a small coterie of very savvy investors detects early hints in arcane data that the U.S. housing market is poised for collapse.  To determine if facts on the ground comport with their data-driven hunches, Steve Carrell‚Äôs character (Mark Baum) does some reconnaissance work in Florida and Vegas.  He discovers that realtors are engaging in dishonest and shoddy loan practices and home foreclosures are spiking.  And in a particularly humorous moment in the film, Baum encounters a stripper who owns multiple homes bought w dubious loans.  This is an a-ha moment: if unskilled sex workers have become players in real estate shell games, it‚Äôs not long before the whole thing collapses.  Baum subsequently makes short trades to take advantage of the impending fall.  

However, Baum has a strong moral compass and a deep sense of right and wrong.  He is dismayed and troubled by the fact that so many people are profiting from this impending disaster which will hurt many everyday people and cost taxpayers huge sums.

A lot of attractiveness is not due to genetics but due to decisions people make.

People who are motivated and not lazy take care of their bodies and go to the gym, which is considered attractive. They cook their own food and avoid the convenience of eating fast food, which is what lazy people do. People who cook at home will look healthier and more attractive than people who eat fast food.

People who are wealthy can afford to do hair treatments and skin treatments, and plastic surgery. 

People who are lazy usually do not pay that much attention to grooming themselves, do not get haircuts, and certainly don't want to do anything extra like plastic surgery.

People who are motivated are more successful than people who are lazy.

The film scene in the meme is the opposite though. The hedge fund manager (pictured) just spoke to strippers getting mortgages and found out that they all owned multiple properties.

You & I have no idea the circumstances or reasoning as to why others make the money they make the way they do. 

It could be someone who dashes once or twice on the way home from work to cover a lunch bill or get some extra money for dinner, or even extra gas money.

Someone could be an independent contractor (outside of courier services) and be in between jobs for a little bit.

Others could be using multiple services when not on the other. Get off Doordash, go to Uber, then Ubereats, to Grub Hub, etc. The ‚Äú50k car or 100k car‚Äù could be primarily used for Ride Sharing services that are upper end like Uber XL or so be it.

I just don‚Äôt get the judgement of people who are actively working. Who cares? There‚Äôs a demand for couriers, they are supplying it. 

Hell, that super expensive car could be a loaner or a relatives that they are borrowing.

Who‚Äôs more questionable, the person delivering food in a nice car, or the customer ordering a personal taxi for their food (plus fees, times etc.) for convenience sake and then getting weird about their driver / tipping. Pretty sure you can do payment plans on those apps now too, which is even more of a questionable act.

He also does stonks and other stuff and gives pretty good financial advice, but I remember when he first got laid off and was panicking that he wouldn't be able to keep up with his mortgage and car notes or anything.  He has like 4 different income sources now and feels a lot more confident in his ability to make things work.  I think he also paid off the car recently.


I also know someone who *bought* a new car while barely making ends meet and tried doing Uber to make extra cash, and he ended up going through a bad turn of events where he just got burned out with everything, got fired and struggled finding another job, crashed the car, and ended up just doing Uber (which he absolutely hated at that point, bro was NOT social) in his mom's car.  It as embarassing but he ended up finding work and quit Uber.


Anyways, idk if I'd draw any conclusions from just two examples, but I do want to say that I *think* it can work if you're a flexible and motivated person and don't plan on it being your *only* income source.  It's also important to remember that your regular fares alone won't be much and that what you really want are *tips*.

The next one gearing up will come after a huge tech bubble bursts. This will not be just a ""minor"" recession like the dot com bubble, though. 25 years ago tech was still niche. Now tech is *everything* and I don't think we've fully accounted for how dependant the economy is on tech. It won't just be tech companies going under because everybody depends on tech. It's also made even worse because tech companies have become monopolies so they're the last chair left and the music is about to stop. 

Take FB as just one example. If you only use it to keep track of friends, families and interests then NBD. If Meta folded and in the wake FB took a massive decline that will affect who knows how many small businesses that have come to depend on it.

Where TF are these small businesses gong to go that has even a fraction of the marketing reach of FB? Craigslist? Back to their neglected web sites that nobody visits anymore because updating products on FB is so much easier and sells so much better? The ripple effects could be huge.

These aren't tech businesses for the most part. Locally I know several ski hills that drive most online ticket sales through FB. I know a boutique soap company that would be totally fucked without FB.

That's just one part of the full tech ecosystem that would fuck so many people if it failed. We only know how to prop up banks that are too big to fail but we don't recognize that FB services might be TBTF, too, much less have a plan to keep that going in the face of a crash.",4,1742824400.0

You are right about the costs though, and that is because BMW wants to sell you on their ""Maintenance Subscription"" where a lot of those costs come with your ""plan"".

But that plan and everything existed before the hyper-inflation of vehicles in 2020.

BMW was always the ""entry brand"" to the luxury car market, they built a customer base by being more cost-accessible luxury cars compared to the likes of Mercedes.

Which, if they increase their prices much, they will be competing in a market they don't have the tools for. (True Luxury Cars)

You can pause orders or decline them, you can stop any time you want, it doesn't hurt you at all to tell the app you can do it for a certain time (it asks so it doesn't have too many drivers in one area, they basically book you for an area in a time slot you give them, and doesn't let you Dash if it has enough drivers in that area, pick a new one or go home kind of deal).

There were all sorts of crackpot-ass theories and ideas that came up during the Great Depression; Technocracy, Inc being one of them... and little Elon's own grandfather was a member of that very movement. Annoyingly, there are parts of the Technocracy, Inc movement that I agree with, but the overarching idea of a world run by scientists and engineers has about as many holes in it as anything else.

We know, today with hindsight, that the end of the Great Depression was met with the FDR New Deal - and we collectively agree that it was generally a good thing. As much as I can be a doomer, I'm remaining optimistic that this era of American history will see a golden ending much the same way that the Depression did in the 1930s.",1,1742867214.0

Had another guy who was a bored retiree who got into day trading. He hands me his brokerage statement and my jaw dropped. He had $35 million in stock proceeds. I was about to ask him where the hell he got that much money when I saw the basis that was reported: $34,998,000. The guy made a boatload of trades totaling $35 million dollars to make like $2,000.

However, there are tons of tax firms that are *ripping* people off when all they're doing is tossing their 1099s into that bitch.

A few years ago I had a complex tax year when all at once I had property sale and brief rental income nonsense, AMT fuckery with exercising ISO and RSU shares across calendar years, freelance work, and much more. Got quoted $600 for an accountant to do it and I said the same thing people here are: fuck that I'll do it myself. 

I ended up wasting over 8 hours putting it together - a *complete* waste if I consider I get paid $150/hr freelance - and then a year later ended up with a nasty heart-attack inducing CP2000 letter from the IRS saying I had to pay $80,000 in back taxes because I messed up one of my forms. I had to spend then $3k for a Tax Attorney to clear it up, and he did, but after all that stress and eventual $3000 out my pocket, $600 would have been quite the small price to pay to not have to deal with any of that.

Many countries have tariffs on the US it is true, but this in itself stems from all the subsidies the US government pays out, especially to farmers of various types. Countries need to protect their farmers from predatory pricing. 

All he is doing is triggering isolation, where nobody will be able to sell to the US due to tariffs, and won't be able to buy from the US due to reciprocal tariffs. 

This is why I hate subsidies. All it does is prolong the inevitable, and force prices down, triggering tariffs. If an industry can't naturally stand on its own 2 feet, it deserves to die. Unfortunately, governments tend to not get re-elected when that happens so we end up with this mess.

\[Wiseguys ‚ÄûDu Doof‚Äú\]

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWWQAPfdoC4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWWQAPfdoC4)

You are the exact opposite of smart  
You think you're hip, and that's enough for a start  
You're content, but you're not all there  
And the worst part is, you just don't care  
You confuse expensive clothes with style  
You confuse a lot, by a mile  
No matter the topic, you understand zip

\[Chorus\]  
You're Trump  
You're Trump

To put it nicely, you're an embarrassing sight  
Know nothing, yet an opinion on every fight  
I'd hate to see you drunk, for real  
'Cause sober, you're already a bad deal  
You love making dump remarks out loud  
You're on the same level as Goofy and a clown  
No matter the topic, you understand zip

\[Chorus\]  
You're Trump  
You're Trump

I've phrased this clearly, just for you  
So maybe even a fool like you gets a clue  
There are hundreds of thousands like you around  
In trendy bars, department stores, clubs, and town  
On the street, at McDonald's, sometimes camping out  
In museums, in theaters, but not that often, no doubt

\[Chorus\]  
You're Trump  
You're Trump

You've really lost all your marbles, I bet  
Where there should be a brain, there's only cotton candy, I get

\[Chorus\]  
You're Trump  
You're Trump

God surely has mercy on you, my friend  
For it is written: blessed are the simple-minded, to the end  
But sometimes I wonder, who should take the blame?  
Can heaven really handle so many of the same?

\[Chorus\]  
You're Trump  
You're Trump  
You're Trump  
You're Trump",1,1743627610.0

And I think I remember some conservative administrations practically throwing out all tariffs, hawking ""free trade, cheaper product for the USA, win-win.""  Put the steel mills in a bad position, as India was exporting steel at the time, and China, and I'm not sure who else.  

Now suddenly this administration wants to impose across the board tariffs.  Not gradually increasing tariffs, to allow domestic business to grow.  (You know, the businesses a previous administration threw to the wolves.)  Does the USA have the capacity to make enough steel to meet the domestic demand for steel?  I don't think so.  Aluminum is another one.  Do we have the resources to meet the demand? I don't think so.  Do we have the resources to make chips?  Well, we have more than we used to thanks to a Democratic administration's efforts to subsidize the startup of chip plants after the covid debacle.  (Big Business came in gangbusters to take that free money!  But they would not pledge that they wouldn't move overseas in the future. Really.)

Prices for everything we don't have the capacity to produce ourselves ... the sky's the limit on what the market will charge you 'n' me for the things we need.  So yeah, we are really fucked.  Really really fucked.  Totally helplessly fucked.  

Someone is going to be raking in the bucks, one way or another, the entire time this is going on ... while the poor who lived on the margins will be out in the streets. 

This administration is collapsing our entire society so the rich can plunder it.  They don't care if the country falls; communism is the same as democracy to them, because The Art of the Deal is all that matters, money is power, more money is more power.

I mean, anybody who argues that this is a bad idea, assuming Team Trump implements these tariffs exactly as presented, is obviously just blindly anti-Trump. Any country responding to these tariffs that is on that list better have a good explanation for why they are increasing their own tariffs. I look forward to the scrambling for explanations.

My wife is Vietnamese, but Viet Nam tariffs American imports by 90%? If that is true, then fuck them, 45% tariffs on Vietnamese imports into this country are justified.

Working for this big international school group. Needed to order certain supplies and the best supplier was a US company.

So went through the process, checking budget, done. Requesting approval, done. Pricing to the higher ups that it was within budget and necessary, done.

After much work and dealing with the time zone difference to the US (email responses with the US company were always a day delayed due to this).

So each time a question needed answering, that would add a full day to the process (and several questions would come up, often a new answer lead to a new question.

Eventually the supplies reached Cambodia. Get a notification, supplies are with customs. HUGE tax owed on US import. Extremely rigorous documentation needed even for simple items (literally just fancy stickers in this case)

Worse yet major financial penalties for each day the item is held in Cambodian customs.

Taxes and penalties ended up costing actual thousands. Not a fun experience at all.",10,1743631794.0

1. **Restructuring Global Trade:** They plan to adjust trade in favor of the U.S. by imposing tariffs and forcing foreign countries to comply with U.S. demands to gain access to the American market.
2. **Reducing U.S. Debt:** A radical debt restructuring is proposed, where holders of U.S. bonds would exchange them for 100-year bonds without interest, helping to alleviate the national debt burden.
3. **Securing Resource Dominance:** Trump's administration views control over natural resources as essential and has hinted at acquiring strategic assets like Greenland.

  
I have no idea if that is true whatsoever. That is just a summary of an article that I've read. Just google  ""Mar-a-Lago Accord"". I have no idea if that is actually the plan and to what extent/ how far the plan goes.

1jpyz81,You know your calls are cooked when the board comes out,ml39zx9,ssuurr33,"I know this might be a hard concept to grasp but, here it goes:

1 - Scenario: Other countries impose tariffs on you:

‚Ä¢	‚Å†Who pays? Your exporters pay (THE BUSINESSES).
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Who wins? Foreign governments, by collecting tariff revenue.

2 - Scenario: You impose tariffs on everyone:

‚Ä¢	‚Å†Who pays? Your own consumers and businesses.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Who wins? Your government, by collecting tariff revenue.

The real difference is that in scenario 2, local producers might be benefited by the increase in price on foreign products. On the other hand, companies that rely on imported products may suffer, increasing production costs and therefore, increasing the final price of said product.

The US populace will pay. On everything. The US government will benefit. And we all know the US government couldn‚Äôt give less of a fuck about their own populace, as you don‚Äôt even have free education or healthcare.

Being tariffed by what you export is one thing. Tariffing EVERYTHING you import is just fucking absurd behavior, specially when you manage a a country who lives on a trade deficit, like the USA, who imports MORE than what they export (‚Ä¶) 1.2 trillion dollars more, to be specific.

This fucking guy has no clue what he‚Äôs doing. If it wasn‚Äôt this tragic, it would be fucking hilarious.

Edit: The USA was always ok with importing more because the USD was always a strong currency, the de facto currency. This might change, even though I don‚Äôt believe it. If it does, it might make foreign companies look into the US with interest to import from, at the cost of the average USA resident losing buying power.",3,1743627630.0

1jpyz81,You know your calls are cooked when the board comes out,ml3pwgn,Basharria,"Tariffs are a sign of a (generally) smaller economy, or a country that doesn't have as big a scale as the country they're putting tariffs on. They represent the government interceding to protect domestic production,  in order to fight off cheaper foreign goods overtaking the market. Sometimes, it's done for strategic purposes too. Most of the time it's targeted to specific areas and they scale, for example Canada has a lot of scaling diary tariffs in order to protect domestic farms. No country wants to import all of their food.



The USA is a powerful economy. We had lesser tariffs because the citizens like buying cheap goods and America has incredible buying power. Our GDP crushes other countries.



Thinking that we have to ""make things fair"" via tariffs is childlike thinking, because we're already the biggest, baddest bully on the block and we generally get what we want in trade deals. These countries use tariffs because if they didn't we bulldoze their domestic production with our much greater economies of scale and capitol and put their local companies out of business.



Most of the numbers on this board are invented, made up, cherrypicked, or exaggerated and taken out of context. They ignore the actual complex realities of globalized trade. Trying to ""equalize"" tariffs makes no sense to do.",1,1743632524.0

Australia is an island. That gives us the ability to closely monitor what comes across our border, because it can only arrive by sea and air. And it‚Äôs a very big island with a very small population : diseases and pests can very quickly get out of control. And have done so in the past. 

So we have very high standards for quarantining and monitoring goods that come in. Those standards are higher than the US‚Äôs. I don‚Äôt have the knowledge to say whether this is actually true, but our beef industry and our government is currently saying that the US doesn‚Äôt have the same level of tracking to give us an absolute guarantee that there‚Äôs no risk of mad cow disease in US meat, or in meat that comes into the US and can then be exported on to Australia. 

The US beef industry would no doubt point to the fact that there‚Äôs been no outbreak of mad cow disease for 20 years. 

But that comes back to the point: Australia takes quarantine and biosecurity very seriously, because in our circumstances we just have to.

Edit to add: and with the likes of RFK Jr in the US administration, now does not seem to be a good time to be re-negotiating bio-security standards.",41,1743637669.0

So the actual price paid to the manufacturer for the product is often less than 5% of the final price.

On May 2, imported goods from China and Hong Kong that would historically qualify for the exemption will be subject to all applicable duties, as long as they did not enter the U.S. via the international postal network.

If they do enter via the postal system, a duty rate of either 30% of their value or $25 per item will apply in lieu of any other fees. The $25 charge will increase to $50 per item after June 1.

1jpyz81,You know your calls are cooked when the board comes out,ml5ku8t,R073X,"Basically a put contract is a game that's going to be played, where if a stock reaches at & under a price, the buyer will be able to make the seller of the contract buy the shares of this whatever it is, in the moment of time within the contract where the condition of what the prices below becomes true. The buy price is determined already as what would be able to trigger this transaction from the option, and if it happens, the money the buyer makes is going to be the difference between the actual value of the stock after this period of time (detailed in the contract that's agreed in) against what both parties agreed to ahead of time to what the number would be where it would be able to be triggered. 

And what the other person gets out of this possible risk venture is no matter what happens, whether  buyer is right o is laughably wrong on what actually happens with the stock in the future,  the seller get the charge the other person for the imposition of possibly losing their ass financially. 

And what deters people from just blindly buying put contracts and taking on these predictions on what's going to happen for free, is that they're always going to be charged this premium price of admission no matter what in the beginning for playing this game. 

 So people who sell a put could make free money when the prices isn't reached, and like I said before the person who pays the rent of this wager....nobody is going to protect them from making a bad prediction, or a good prediction that wasn't quick enough  because the lifetime of the contract ends before it might actually happen in real life - even if the trends of why somebody would gamble in this way were still being worked towards afterward. 

And the buyer wins when theyre able to sell shares of this stock at a profit because , and when it's above the current market price of the commodity. So ultimately when the buyer would have actual profit from this game is when the difference of that prediction versus the current stock price is greater than the admission price of playing, and likewise, the seller loses a great deal of money when they have to buy shares for a price per share that is seemingly above fair market value, and adds up to me more than what they charged as the fee to play",4,1743658107.0

The US imports $63.4 bil from Switzerland, and exports $25.0 bil to Switzerland. That's a deficit of -61%. So Switzerland gets a 31% tariff.

The US imports $22.2 bil from Israel, and exports $14.8 bil to Israel. That's a deficit of -33%. So Israel gets a 17% tariff.

>The books explicitly call for a collapse of the existing order. The authors already believe that the United States is bound to failure, due to the perceived reliance on ‚Äúprinting money,‚Äù or US dollar hegemony. Even as a full collapse may be difficult to achieve, they can benefit from any partial destabilization they can induce.

>‚ÄúWe believe that a new phase is coming in the development of human society. All will collapse‚Äîboth Europe and America, and the U.S. dollar. It‚Äôs a matter of time. By the way, if the dollar collapses, after that crashes the old world order.‚Äù‚Äî Yuri Shalyganov (an author of Project Russia)

>Russia‚Äôs program of hybrid warfare is thus focused on critiquing democracy, driving societal divisions, and promoting Russia‚Äôs unique role in the world. This, they believe, will lead to the downfall of the global dollar system.

>The capture of the presidency by Putin through his proxies DT and Elon Musk presents a unique opportunity to accelerate destabilization. On January 20, 2025, we will face a barrage of chaotic assaults including potential US debt default, damaging new tariffs, mass firings of federal employees, and catastrophic budget cuts. Their primary target, the dollar, will be assaulted from every angle.

>Unfortunately, there is a natural constituency for Putin‚Äôs accelerationist agenda in the United States. Elon Musk has mentioned the concept of ‚ÄòAmerican Bankruptcy‚Äô no fewer than 25 times since March 2024 ‚Äî and eight times in November alone.

>In addition to Musk and his DOGE colleagues Vivek Ramaswamy and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), Ron Paul, Gary North, Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY), and Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) have all expressed support for terminating the Federal Reserve, and favor new currency models, including cryptocurrencies.

>House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) has ties to the energy firm American Ethane, and has been backed by Konstantin Nikolaev, a Putin crony and the largest shareholder of American Ethane.

This led to a bunch of speculative bubbles in the rail road industry and as people do, they over invested in that specific asset leading to an overbuilding of railroads. 

The Jay Cooke and Company, a major railroad company at the time, collapsed like Bear Sterns and boom went the market. There were also other big bad confounding issues that led to it getting worse such as the Chicago Fire, the US going on the Gold standard, a collapse in the railroad bond market from EUROPEAN BOND SELL OFFs.

That‚Äôs not all. I decided to just grab this from Wikipedia because I didn‚Äôt want to paraphrase it:

‚ÄúThe period preceding the Long Depression had been one of increasing economic internationalism, championed by efforts such as the Latin Monetary Union, many of which then were derailed or stunted by the impacts of economic uncertainty.[40] The extraordinary collapse of farm prices[16] provoked a protectionist response in many nations. Rejecting the free trade policies of the Second Empire, French president Adolphe Thiers led the new Third Republic to protectionism, which led ultimately to the stringent M√©line tariff in 1892.[41] Germany's agrarian Junker aristocracy, under attack by cheap, imported grain, successfully agitated for a protective tariff in 1879 in Otto von Bismarck's Germany over the protests of his National Liberal Party allies.[41] In 1887, Italy and France embarked on a bitter tariff war.[42] In the United States, Benjamin Harrison won the 1888 US presidential election on a protectionist pledge.‚Äù

While the extra $25 is paid to the taiwan seller, it effectively goes to pay off the debt they went into for patying the US government the cost of the tarrif.

And they tend to not work very in your favour when you decide to tariff EVERYONE.

Let‚Äôs imagine I have a candy shop. And in the street right next to my shop, there‚Äôs another candy shop.

I have a tariff imposed on me by the district on candy sold to students that I bought from a supplier, so everytime I sell that kind of candy to kids, they pay a little more.

Now take into consideration, I can make SOME candy, but I still buy way more candy from my supplier than what I make myself. And kids like my suppliers candy better than my own.

I get mad at this, what do I do? I impose a tariff on my candy supplier, and somehow, I try to reason with everyone that the supplier is the one paying this tariff extra.

In reality, I make kids pay the extra. I hope they buy the candy I make, but instead they decide to just go the candy shop across the street instead.

Now I‚Äôm forced to make pretty much all of the candy I sell only to keep my clientele, and I‚Äôm not ready for it. I may try to make the candy my supplier makes for me, but it will take time. I may never be capable of doing so. I may also be ready eventually, and at that time it can be too late and the candy shop across the street may have all the kids addicted to crack, and here I am, crackless, tired, with no clients, no money and with a shitty relation with my supplier.

Hopefully, in 4 years I will close my candy shop, someone else will come and buy the business, amend the relation with the supplier and try to fix all of this mess.

Edit: In a more serious note, tariffs could work to protect your businesses and to guarantee your populace buys locally and buys something with better quality.

But this only works when you tariff shit you can actually make profitably in house.

It tends to go to shit as soon as you start applying tariffs  left and right, to business partners, trade allies, to goods your businesses need to keep production, goods you simply are not ready to produce, and goods made by American companies on foreign soil.

It's also why some island with 2000 inhabitant supposedly had 60% ""tariff"" on the US, because they sold $250,000 of good to the US and bought only $100,000 from the US so there's a $150,000 trade deficit, therefore, 60% ""tariff"" on the US.",7,1743643134.0

Tariffs are not ""on companies operating abroad"". They are paid by the importer, in the US in this case. The amount of this cost that is passed on to the consumer or absorbed in fewer sales by the exporter is largely a function of the good's elasticity. 

Further... A tariff is charged before the good is sold to the consumer, thus increasing the cost of the good. Corporate taxes are only charged on profits, after the sale of the good. 

These differences achieve different results. One of those results is that more of the burden from tariffs is passed on to consumers than is corporate tax burden.

Nodes, layers upon layers of them with links to each node, any single or even many failing simply causes packets to reroute, it does not cause system failure- it's robust and self healing.¬†


Imagine if instead a third of all network traffic travelled through a single node. How much power the one who possess that node would accumulate! Nothing would be off limits to them, a flick of the switch and whole networks would go black in an instant.¬†


Back to globalisation, the global economy. The US owned such a node for a long time. Used it to quash the Nazis, push back the Japanese, rebuild Europe, lead a hegemon against the Soviet Union and ultimately defeat it.¬†


Today China is a third of the world's manufacturing, twice the size of the US it's closest competitor.It's half the worlds shipbuilding. It processes 90% of its rare earths, and owns the low end semiconductor industry-anything over 22nm is made in China. It's the Soviet Union on steroids, because there's no inner states to play against themselves, it's been a single homogeneous entity since we were inventing stories about kings called Arthur and before the Americas was even known to Europeans.¬†


And every year, it increases its industrial base, it's economic power, it's military forces. It's not a decade behind, or 5 years, or 6 months. In many fields it's leading.¬†


And somehow, with the strangest throw of the dice modern semiconductors- the entire basis of what's left of America's wealth, the machines the Magnificent 7 need to keep their technology empires alive- are all manufactured right on China's doorstep.¬†


When, not if but when China takes Taiwan it will have almost completed the mission of its leader. Xi made a speech in 2012, about reversing the Century of Humiliation and the steps along the way. He called out 2048 as the year China both economically and militarily regains the crown it wore for 18 of the last 20 centuries.¬†


Each step has been completed since 2012, on time. And the next step, in the next couple of years, is reunification with Taiwan.¬†


So yeah, a long winded way of saying sure globalisation is inevitable, and it doesn't have to be a bad thing- many diverse economies trading with each other in many diverse loops and trade routes would be a fantastic stabilising and enriching system.¬†


But what we have today is far from that result, it's a web where China is in the middle and everything important relies on it, everything apart from sub 22nm semiconductors- and they are directly in its grasp it simply has to reach out.¬†",1,1743646271.0

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoot%E2%80%93Hawley_Tariff_Act

>**After enactment**

>At first, the tariff seemed to be a success. According to historian Robert Sobel, ""Factory payrolls, construction contracts, and industrial production all increased sharply."" However, larger economic problems loomed in the guise of weak banks. When the Creditanstalt of Austria failed in 1931, the global deficiencies of the Smoot‚ÄìHawley Tariff became apparent.[16] U.S. imports decreased 66% from $4.4 billion (1929) to $1.5 billion (1933), and exports decreased 61% from $5.4 billion to $2.1 billion. GNP fell from $103.1 billion in 1929 to $75.8 billion in 1931 and bottomed out at $55.6 billion in 1933.[25] Imports from Europe decreased from a 1929 high of $1.3 billion to just $390 million during 1932, and U.S. exports to Europe decreased from $2.3 billion in 1929 to $784 million in 1932. Overall, world trade decreased by some 66% between 1929 and 1934.[26]

>Unemployment was 8% in 1930 when the Smoot‚ÄìHawley Act was passed but the new law failed to lower it. The rate jumped to 16% in 1931 and to 25% in 1932‚Äì1933.[27] There is some contention about whether this can necessarily be attributed to the tariff.[28][29] The Great Depression was already in motion before Smoot-Hawley, mainly due to financial instability, falling demand, and poor banking practices. However, the tariff worsened the crisis by shrinking global trade, hurting farmers, and reducing employment in export-dependent industries. Had it not passed, the Depression still would have occurred, but perhaps with less severity.

>It was only during World War II, when ""the American economy expanded at an unprecedented rate"",[30] that unemployment fell below 1930s levels.[31] Imports during 1929 were only 4.2% of the U.S. GNP, and exports were only 5.0%. Monetarists, such as Milton Friedman, who emphasized the central role of the money supply in causing the depression, considered the Smoot‚ÄìHawley Act to be only a minor cause for the Great Depression in the United States.[32]

And strictly speaking in terms of specs and performance compared to the original Switch, when you adjust for inflation the US price of the Switch 2 is quite fair. The overall value prop of the game catalog as well as the price of the games themselves might be another matter, but the price of the hardware itself is competitive. I find a lot of what Nintendo does to be pretty disagreeable and anti-consumer, but the Switch 2 pricing isn't one of those things.",8,1743637011.0

But that isn't that surprising considering Japanese cars are pretty high quality and Japan is very proud of their cars, so there's a very strong patriotic impulse to buy their own cars.


The US has historically heavily tariffed Japanese cars though, which is why many Japanese car companies did end up building factories in North America.

Increasing corporate taxes does not DIRECTLY affect products produced by those companies. Corporate income taxes are levied on a company‚Äôs profits, not on individual transactions. Companies can try to pass these costs on to consumers through higher prices, but the extent to which they can do this depends on market competition, demand elasticity, and other such factors. A lot of the burden is often taken on by shareholders in order to maintain competitive pricing.

Now let's look at, for instance, the Taiwan tariffs. That's a direct increase on the price of semiconductors for Americans, and Taiwan has no reason to lower their prices in response since they have no competition from US companies.

1jpyz81,You know your calls are cooked when the board comes out,ml50c18,rdrckcrous,"Think about it a few layers deeper.  We're talking about an economy.  A nation as big as the US cannot have a roaring economy around services alone for very long.  The heart of the economy in the US was, and always will be manufacturing.  Those coffee beans don't just get picked.  They have to be processed, they need a building to be built, they need trucking and banking and lawyers.  They need to buy equipment to process the coffee.  The taxes collected from the employees goes to schools and roads.  What happens to us long term if we don't keep manufacturing?  It doesn't matter what industry your kid is in.

The people you're worried about understand this, and they don't care about you or your kids one bit.  They're not going to start making policies to help poor American kids when the tables are turned from generations of short and small thinking policy.

Adrenaline was likely a factor, especially if the kid knew cops were climbing up to apprehend him so he felt rushed. Another factor was the kid‚Äôs choice to aim for the head instead of center mass. A chest shot with a 5.56 round would‚Äôve almost certainly done the trick. Center mass makes for a much easier target‚Äîespecially while adrenaline is flowing, making it much more difficult to be precise (which is why in basic training and at the police academy we‚Äôre trained to aim center mass).",3,1743644508.0
